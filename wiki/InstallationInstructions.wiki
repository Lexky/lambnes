general instructions on installation and use of lambnes software

If all has gone well, the jar is self-executing, containing all source and dependencies. I have personally ran the jar from the command line. 

After downloading the jar, execute
java -jar lambnes.jar /path/to/rom.zip

At this time, this is the key mapping:<br />
W: up<br />
A: left<br />
D: right<br />
X: down<br />
J: A<br />
K: B<br />
esc: select<br />
enter: start<br />
There are plans to implement the ability to customize key mapping.
